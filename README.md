# Huffman-Encoding
Huffman coding is a popular data compression algorithm that is commonly used for compressing text files. It works by assigning variable-length codes to different characters in a text file, with the goal of using shorter codes for more frequently occurring characters and longer codes for less frequently occurring characters.
